# MATLAB-Octave-collection
This repository is a collection of .m files that are written in Octave (should work in MATLAB for the most part).
These examples will show how to do many of the basic mathmatical concepts and graphs such as convolution and fourier series (okay not so basic but you get the point)

## A record of the uploaded examples

   1a. __filename__: ConvolutionOfExponentWithStep.m <br>
   1b. __description__: A graph of the convolution between 2 periodic functions, the first is an exponential decay and the other is a square pulse with + and - parts.
